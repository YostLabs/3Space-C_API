/**
 * @ Author: Andy Riedlinger
 * @ Create Time: 2025-6-20 11:45:00
 *
 * @ Description:
 * A wrapper class to add the peek functionality and
 * buffered writing to a minimal com class.
 * 
 * Also contains default implementations for some of the other
 * functions, such as read_until and clear that can be used
 * by minimal com classes.
 * 
 * @note:
 * If both TSS_MINIMAL_SENSOR=1 and TSS_BUFFERED_WRITES=0,
 * this class only wraps calls and provides no additional functionality
